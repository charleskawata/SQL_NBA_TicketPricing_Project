# SQL_NBA_TicketPricing_Project

# Project Objective
With Covid-19 restrictions lifting and our country begins to return to normal, NBA teams have to navigate how they are going to bring back fans into arenas and price tickets accordingly. There are many challenges for teams to price tickets which include state mandated capacity limits, hesitancy among fans, and safety. 

I am going to be solving this problem by looking at the remaining games from April 19, 2021 to the end of the 2020-2021 season pulled from the TicketMaster API and historical data on all 30 NBA teams

# Job Description
I was inspired to take on this project because of my love for basketball and a job posting I saw for a Director of Ticket Sales for the Los Angeles Clippers and was interested in exploring the position. The job responsibilities of the role include 
- Provide leadership and establish a positive sales culture for the Ticket Sales department through the hiring, training, coaching and mentorship of all ticketing staff to achieve team established team individual ticketing and related business annual revenue goals.

I was inspired to take a look at the problem of ticket pricing while I was searching for data to analyze and instead of just looking at ticket pricing for the LA Clippers I decied to look at all of the teams. 

# Data
I got half of my data from the TicketMaster API which I pulled in my `Data`
